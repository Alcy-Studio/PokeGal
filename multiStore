MultiStore is good to apply the read only system
or affect moc

Static model is quite big, in addition, it is not necessary to change frequently
always preserve the dynamic model/user data/readWrite (Girl, User, Schedule, ), put static/readonly model aside

The main reason for setting up MultiStore is not for memory efficiency. Indeed, it's for simplier future extension.

primary store should be temp (auto save) keep small for memory benefit, usually user data which auto save frequently
secondary stores should be extendable (manual save) base or event, or 


primary store: 
- Alcy (Girl): attributes(*), name, birthday, Age, Blood type, personality, progress(*), Note, 
- Grace (Girl): 
- user: attributes, gift, items, achievement, money, action point, place, scheduled

Secondary store:
- base (system, non-plugin)
- recurring event (reDefined-Graphic2D & Text & BGM) customized each record for specific event
- recurring event (data for NSCalendar)
- user event (data for display)
- user event (data for NSCalendar)

- user photos (user photos & user background for tour/trip) (version2)
- independent, should include all required repository without interfere other store such as base

the style for plugin store should be same as primary store, except the plugin store has a smaller scale
