Debug Method: 
gdlv = 1 //Global Debug Level

NSAssert(gd >= 1 ,@"Action - setCombo Failed") //lv 1
NSAssert1(gd >= 2 ,@"Action - value = %i", var1) //lv 2
NSAssert2(gd >= 3 ,@"Definition: value1 = %i, value2 = %i", var1, var2) //lv 3

#define NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS //Block Assert while done assertion

Can't build to device
1. Use GCC 4.2 instead of LLVM

Debug Level Severity
Set Global Debug Value: 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.

EXE_BAD_ACCESS: 
etc. 1. dictionary key <> NSString*
%@ <> %d

So whenever there are that many stack frames, it means there is some sort of infinite recursion going on. 
My guess is that when creating a D object, there is some code that automatically creates something else, 
which in turn is creating another D and there is a loop that is unterminated. 
I would start by checking any Key Value Observers or NSManagedObject Overrides

Ah! Found the solution! In my D object i had a property named "description". 
That corresponds to the many calls to description in the stack frames. 
I renamed it to "desc" and it now works. Would be nice if I found a list with all the reserved words... 
-----------------------
Don't ever use other target instead of "self" when assigning scheduled timer. Wrong thing will be happen if the vc
dealloc while the target is still there.
