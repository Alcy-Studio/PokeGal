Hi Everyone! This is the source code of PokeGal, which developed in 2010. I decided to post it as I won't use it as the framework of next release. The code is in pure objective-C. In 2010, I didn't have much choice for coding iOS game. I have to use either Cocos2D or ObjC. The codes run fine with Xcode 3 at that time. However, it does not get along with Xcode 5, so it makes upgrade a lot harder.I'm okay to provide better gameplay in every update. Tho,  I don't really want to update for Apple's technical issue(sorry my team is not big enough to sustain that). If I happen to make a new version for iOS/Android. I'll code it in Javascript for sure.
