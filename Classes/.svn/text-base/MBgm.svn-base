Preferred Audio Formats in iOS
For uncompressed (highest quality) audio, use 16-bit, little endian, linear PCM 
audio data packaged in a CAF file. You can convert an audio file to this format 
in Mac OS X using the afconvert command-line tool, as shown here:

/usr/bin/afconvert -f caff -d LEI16 {INPUT} {OUTPUT}

for %i in (*.wav) do afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@44100 -c 1 %i %~ni.caf

for %i in (*.ogg) do afconvert -f caff -d LEI16 -c 1 %i %~ni.caf

The afconvert tool lets you convert to a wide range of audio data formats and file
 types. See the afconvert man page, and enter afconvert -h at a shell prompt, for more information.

For compressed audio when playing one sound at a time, and when you donâ€™t need to
 play audio simultaneously with the iPod application, use the AAC format packaged in a CAF or m4a file.

For less memory usage when you need to play multiple sounds simultaneously, use 
IMA4 (IMA/ADPCM) compression. This reduces file size but entails minimal CPU 
impact during decompression. As with linear PCM data, package IMA4 data in a CAF file.
